    <h2>MARS ORBITER MISSION(MANGALYAAN)</h2>
    <p><b>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), unofficially known as Mangalyaan (Sanskrit: Maṅgala 'Mars', Yāna 'Craft,
            Vehicle'), was a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by
            the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was India's first interplanetary mission and it made ISRO
            the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit, after Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space
            Agency. It made India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the second national space agency in
            the world to do so on its maiden attempt after the European Space Agency did in 2003.</b></p>

    <h2>CHANDRAYAAN 1</h2>
    <p><b>Chandrayaan-1 (pronunciation; from Sanskrit: Chandra, "Moon" and yāna, "craft, vehicle") was the first Indian
            lunar probe under the Chandrayaan programme. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission consisted of an orbiter and an impactor.
            India launched the spacecraft using a PSLV-XL rocket on 22 October 2008 at 00:52 UTC from Satish Dhawan
            Space Centre, at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as
            India researched and developed its own technology to explore the Moon.The vehicle was inserted into lunar
            orbit on 8 November 2008.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 14:36 UTC and struck
            the south pole in a controlled manner. The probe hit near the crater Shackleton at 15:01 UTC.The location of
            the impact was named Jawahar Point.With this mission, ISRO became the fifth national space agency to reach
            the lunar surface. Other nations whose national space agencies achieved similar feats were the former Soviet
            Union in 1959,the United States in 1962, Japan in 1993, and European Space Agency member states in 2006.
            <br>
            <br>
            The estimated cost for the project was ₹386 crore (US$88.73 million). It was intended to survey the lunar
            surface for over two years, to produce a complete map of the chemical composition at the surface and its
            three-dimensional topography. The polar regions were of special interest as there was a high chance of
            finding water ice.One of its many achievements was the discovery of the widespread presence of water
            molecules in lunar soil.
            <br>
            <br>
            After almost a year, the orbiter started experiencing several technical issues including failure of the star
            tracker and poor thermal shielding; Chandrayaan-1 stopped communicating at about 20:00 UTC on 28 August
            2009, shortly after which the ISRO officially declared that the mission was over. Chandrayaan-1 operated for
            312 days as opposed to the intended two years; however, the mission achieved most of its scientific
            objectives, including detecting the presence of Lunar water.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 2 July 2016, NASA used ground-based radar systems to relocate Chandrayaan-1 in its lunar orbit, almost
            seven years after it shut down.Repeated observations over the next three months allowed a precise
            determination of its orbit which varies between 150 and 270 km (93 and 168 mi) in altitude every two years.

    <h2>CHANDRAYAAN - 3</h2>
    <p><b>
            Chandrayaan-3 is the third mission in the Chandrayaan programme, a series of lunar-exploration missions
            developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).The mission consists of a Vikram lunar lander and
            a Pragyan lunar rover was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered
            lunar orbit on 5 August, and India became the first country to touch down near the lunar south pole, at
            69°S, the southernmost lunar landing on 23 August 2023 at 18:04 IST (12:33 UTC), ISRO became the first
            agency to land near the south pole of the moon in its first attempt and overall the fourth space agency to
            successfully land on the Moon, after USSR, NASA and the CNSA.

            Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar
            orbit on 5 August, and became the first lander to touch down near the lunar south poleon 23 August at 18:03
            IST (12:33 UTC), making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and at 69°S, the
            southernmost lunar landing, until IM-1 landed further southwards in Malapert A crater on 22 February
            2024.The lander was not built to withstand the cold temperatures of the lunar night, and sunset over the
            landing site ended the surface mission twelve days after landing.The propulsion module, still operational,
            transited back to a high Earth orbit from lunar orbit on 22 November 2023 for continued scientific
            observations of Earth.It operated until 22 August 2024.

    <h2>SpaDeX</h2>
    <p><b>
            SpaDeX or Space Docking Experiment is a twin satellite mission developed by the Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) to mature and demonstrate technologies related to orbital rendezvous, docking, formation
            flying, which will have future applications in areas such as human spaceflight, in-space satellite servicing
            and other proximity operations.
            <br>
            <br>
            SpaDeX consists of two modified IMS-1 class satellites weighing 220 kg each. During proximity operations one
            spacecraft acts as a Chaser and other acts as a Target.
            <br>
            <br>
            Both spacecraft were launched togetherfrom the First Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre aboard
            a dedicated Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on 30 December 2024 at 16:30:15 UTC and subsequently injected
            into slightly different orbits.
            <br>
            <br>
            After deployment, the two spacecraft then executed manoeuvres to bring them together again. The Chaser
            (SDX01) approached the target (SDX02) and then carried out precision manoeuvres to complete a successful
            docking.With this success, India became only the fourth country to achieve successful space docking
            —following the United States, Russia and China.
